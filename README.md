Bash script for making DDoS attack on fucking russian resources.

Fuck them all!

Some of the VPNs which _may_ have free plans:
	- https://www.tunnelbear.com/
	- https://my.clearvpn.com/
	- https://www.urban-vpn.com/
	- google for more if you don't have a paid one
- Connect your laptop to power, because this script consumes **a lot** of energy.

## Installation

- Install `wrk` utility on your fucking machine.
	- Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install wrk`
	- Macos: `brew install wrk` 
	- Other: https://github.com/wg/wrk
- Adjust `D`, `C`, and `T` variables on your taste.
- Run `chmod a+x fuck-russia.sh`
- Fuck russia!

## Run

```
$ $EDITOR resource.list
$ ./fuck-russion.sh
```

Слава Україні! Героям Слава!
